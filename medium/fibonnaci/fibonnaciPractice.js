// The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers that starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding ones. It is a simple and famous mathematical sequence that has many interesting properties.

// Here's how it begins:

// Start with 0.
// Then, add 1 to 0 to get the next number, which is 1.
// Now, add the last two numbers (1 and 1) to get the next number, which is 2.
// Continue this pattern: add the last two numbers to find the next number.

//input: number
//output: number
//example: fibonacci(3) => 2
